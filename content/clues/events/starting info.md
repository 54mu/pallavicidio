Read this letter and its instructions carefully

Don't share your cards (you'll be able to share them with your teammates on Monday)

For now, open only the CARD envelope and follow the expiration date specified on the other envelopes.

Welcome to the prestigious Pallavicini-Florian-Gerdol Genetics Laboratory, where groundbreaking research and cutting-edge discoveries shape the future of genetics.

Tonight, esteemed scientists, researchers, and students of the Department of Life Sciences gather for a special gala to celebrate the laboratory's latest breakthroughs. Jealousy and old grudges resurface when the Department Director emphasizes that the recent publication in the world's leading science journal opens up new funding opportunities for the laboratory. And everybody knows that meaningful publications open the way to new career achievements.

The evening takes a sinister turn when Prof. Alberto Pallavicini, the renowned founder of the laboratory, is found mysteriously dead by Magdalena, a visiting PhD student from Croatia. As panic and fear spread amongst the guests of the gala, the atmosphere becomes tense and unsettling. The lab members wonder if the police will succeed in their investigation, facing numerous difficulties within the tight-knit University community.

Elettra and Sara, the two faithful PhD students, propose a private investigation as a more effective and subtle approach than the police's. Although everyone agrees, the research group is unable to reach a consensus on the best methods to apply. Members of the Pallavicini lab prefer to follow the guidance of former detective Fiorella Florian, while members of the Giulianini lab would instead rely on the remarkable intuition of the brilliant researcher Chiara Manfini. They agree to conduct separate investigations and fill one another in, but suspicion quickly arises between the two teams. Who could have wanted the Prof dead? Success and money granted Pallavicini a fair number of jealous colleagues, greedy peers, and false friends.

The killer could be anybody...yourself included.

For now, you'll need to rely only on your instincts. But starting from Monday, you'll be able to share your ideas with your teammates:
